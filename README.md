This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

> **Note**: The app is compatible with Node.js 20 and later.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Infomaniak

To deploy the pre-built application on [Infomaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com/):

1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Build the static site with `npm run build`. The generated files will be placed in the `out` directory.
3. Start the Express server with `npm start`.

The server serves the files from the `out` folder and will be ready on the configured port (default `3000`).
